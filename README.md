# CAMU-Simulation-for-Ashesi-University

The primary goal of CAMU is to facilitate efficient course registration, course allocation, and faculty assignment processes while also managing academic records and generating student transcripts. This utility is intended to serve the needs of students, faculty members, and administrative staff by providing a centralized platform for managing course-related activities. 

At the heart of CAMU are six core components: Students, Courses, Faculty, Transcript, TranscriptEntry, and the Data manager itself. Each component plays a crucial role in the functioning of the utility:  

Students: Represent the individuals enrolled in the institution, holding essential information such as their ID, name, major, year group, and the courses they have taken. Students can register or drop courses, calculate their GPA, and access their transcript through the system. 

Courses: Act as the academic units offered by the institution, containing details like the course ID, name, credit hours, year offered, and whether it is a major requirement. Courses keep track of enrolled students and the assigned faculty member, facilitating student enrollment and faculty assignment. 

Faculty: Comprise the teaching staff responsible for delivering course content. Faculty members are associated with the courses they teach and can have multiple courses assigned to them. They play a pivotal role in the educational process, directly influencing the learning outcomes of students. 

Transcript: Is a comprehensive record of a student's academic performance, listing the courses taken along with the grades received and the cumulative GPA. It serves as an official document for evaluating student achievements and progress over time. 

TranscriptEntry: Represents individual records within a Transcript, detailing the course, grade, and semester. These entries collectively provide a historical overview of the student's academic journey. 

Data manager: Serves as the central management entity that orchestrates the interaction between students, courses, and faculty. It is responsible for adding new entities to the system, allocating courses to students based on their year group and major requirements, assigning faculty to courses, and ultimately ensuring that the academic operations run smoothly.
